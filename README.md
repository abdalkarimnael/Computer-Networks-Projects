# Computer-Networks-Projects

1st Project
---

This project is structured into three main parts, each focusing on different aspects of computer networking:
-

Part One:
Covers foundational concepts such as network protocols, addressing schemes, and basic troubleshooting techniques.

Part Two:
Explores practical communication scenarios including intra-computer communication, inter-device communication via physical cables, and wireless communication using Wi-Fi technology.

Part Three:
Extends the exploration to advanced networking scenarios, incorporating server-client interactions, web server setups, and development of a website using HTML and CSS.

Through these structured segments, students progress from understanding foundational principles to practical applications and even website development, gaining a holistic understanding of computer networking.

Project Title: Building a Topology Using Packet Tracer Tool


Summary
---
This Project delves into various aspects of network setup and functionality, including IP subnetting, router configuration, server setup, VLAN management, routing protocols, and connectivity testing.

Project Details
---
Delve into the specifics of IP assignment and subnetting, meticulously outlined in Part 0 of the report. The subsequent sections detail the creation and configuration of the network topology using Packet Tracer, showcasing the setup of routers (Router0, Router1, Router2), servers (HTTP, DNS, Email), and switches. Each configuration is accompanied by detailed figures illustrating the setup process and the associated IOS commands.

Test the connectivity of the network through applying ping and tracert commands, accessing the configured website from various PCs, and sending emails across the network. The report concludes with a meticulous examination of access control lists (ACLs) to enforce network security measures, demonstrating the denial of specific traffic flows as per project requirements.

Explore the intricacies of computer networking through the lens of this comprehensive project report, offering invaluable insights and practical applications for aspiring network engineers and enthusiasts alike.
