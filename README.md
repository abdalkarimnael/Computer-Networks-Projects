The project is divided into three main parts:

Part One: This section likely covers foundational concepts of computer networks, such as network protocols, addressing schemes, and basic network troubleshooting techniques.

Part Two: This section explores communication scenarios both within the same computer and between different devices. It includes:

Communication on the Same Computer: Likely involves implementing and testing communication protocols like TCP and UDP within a single machine.
Communication on Different Devices Through Cable: Involves setting up network communication between devices using physical cables, possibly Ethernet or similar connections.
Communication on Different Devices Through WIFI: Focuses on wireless network communication between devices, likely utilizing Wi-Fi technology.

Part Three: This section likely extends the exploration to more advanced networking scenarios, possibly involving server-client interactions and web server setups. It includes:

Communication on the Same Computer: Further exploration of server-client interactions and web server configurations within a single machine.
Communication on Different Devices: Continuing the exploration of network communication between different devices, possibly involving more complex configurations and scenarios.
